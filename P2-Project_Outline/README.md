# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This application was created for cat owners, cat fans, and anyone who has an interest in making feline friends. All users can search for local shelters, vet clinics, and even cat cafes! There will also be information on what to expect as a cat owner and general overview for how to take care of a cat. This app not only serves as a resource hub but also as a way to connect to other cat owners. Registered users will be able to contact their vet and have access to their pet's health records. A user's profile will list each individual cat and details; like a cat index, so to speak. Admin users will have privileges such as editing text, adding/removing adoption listings, vet clinics, etc. 
### Features
Guest login: Users can access the search function without having to register an account.
User login: Users can create an account, log in to see their profile page that includes any cat profiles they've made, add ratings/reviews for cafes, clinics, etc., and save any favorites.
Admin login: Admins can edit displayed text, add or remove listings and locations so search results are up-to-date.
Search: Users can access lists of local shelters with adopotable pets, cat cafes, and veterinary clinics.
General cat knowledge: Basic information on how to care for cats e.g. foods/plants/etc that are okay and those that are toxic, litter box requirements, necessary vaccinations, etc.
Cat profiles: Users can add their cats and include their name, age, breed, photo(s), notes on food or medications, likes & dislikes, vet reminders, etc.
